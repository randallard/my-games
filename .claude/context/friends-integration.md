## Integration Decision Protocol

When connection-related features are needed:

1. **Claude Code asks**: "Which friends-connect pattern should we integrate?"
2. **Options presented**: Relevant patterns from available repos
3. **User decides**: Which approach to take
4. **Integration planned**: As GitHub issue with clear scope
5. **Implementation**: Following established testing and documentation workflow

## Current Gaming Platform Connection Needs

### Real-Time Communication
**Current**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) with proxy architecture
**Status**: ✅ Working well for turn-based games
**Future Need**: May need friends-connect patterns for:
- Direct peer-to-peer communication
- Connection recovery strategies  
- Multi-player session management beyond 2 players

### Friend Discovery
**Current**: Manual shareable links
**Status**: ✅ Works for basic friend-to-friend gaming
**Future Need**: May need friends-connect patterns for:
- Automatic friend discovery
- Friend list management
- Invitation systems

### Network Resilience
**Current**: Basic SSE reconnection
**Status**: ✅ Basic functionality working
**Future Need**: May need friends-connect patterns for:
- Advanced connection recovery
- Network traversal (NAT, firewalls)
- Fallback communication channels

## Integration Checklist Template

When integrating friends-connect patterns:

- [ ] Identify specific connection need
- [ ] Evaluate relevant patterns from resource repos
- [ ] Ask user which approach to take
- [ ] Create GitHub issue for integration
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Implement with comprehensive tests
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Test with existing gaming platform
- [ ] Merge after all tests pass
