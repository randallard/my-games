# Claude Code Workflow - Now Ready!

## 🎯 Your Claude Code Slash Commands Are Ready

Your transition from Desktop Commander to Claude Code is complete! All commands have been converted to proper markdown prompts that work with Claude Code's slash command system.

### ✅ Available Slash Commands

#### Core Development
- **`/status`** - Development dashboard with Git, testing, and cluster status
- **`/test-all`** - Comprehensive test suite across all 5 services  
- **`/ready-to-commit`** - Full validation before any commit
- **`/merge-friends [feature]`** - Evaluate friends-connect integration options

#### Natural Language Alternatives
You can also use natural language that maps to these commands (defined in `CLAUDE.md`):
- "check status" or "show me current state" → `/status`
- "ready to commit" or "validate before commit" → `/ready-to-commit`
- "run all tests" or "test everything" → `/test-all`
- "need connection features" → `/merge-friends`

### 🏗️ How to Use Your New Workflow

1. **Pull the updates to your local repository:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ryankhetlyr/Development/rust/my-games
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Open Claude Code in the project directory:**
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. **Try your first slash command:**
   ```
   /status
   ```

4. **Or use natural language:**
   ```
   check my current development status
   ```

### 🎮 What Each Command Does

**`/status`**: Comprehensive development dashboard
- Git branch status and uncommitted changes
- Test file counts across services
- k3d cluster and pod health
- Current issue context from .claude/context/
- Available commands and next steps

**`/test-all`**: Complete testing validation
- Runs `cargo test` in all 5 service directories
- Validates k3d cluster health
- Checks documentation currency
- Reports pass/fail with specific error details

**`/ready-to-commit`**: Pre-commit validation gate
- All tests must pass (128+ total expected)
- Git status and branch naming validation
- k3d cluster health verification
- Documentation currency check
- Provides commit readiness summary or specific fixes needed

**`/merge-friends [description]`**: Ask-first integration pattern
- Analyzes available friends-connect repositories
- Evaluates 2-3 specific integration options
- Presents trade-offs and effort estimates
- Asks for your decision before any implementation

```

### 🔧 Context Engineering Features

**CLAUDE.md**: Claude Code automatically reads this file for project context, including:
- Service overview and current status  
- Natural language command mappings
- Build commands and service URLs
- Testing requirements and Git workflow
- Resource integration guidance

**Automatic Context**: When you start Claude Code, it knows:
- Your 5 microservices and their test counts
- k3d deployment architecture
- Jeremy Chone patterns in use
- Available friends-connect resources
- Current development state from .claude/context/

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the workflow**: Try `/status` to see your comprehensive development dashboard
2. **Validate your setup**: Use `/ready-to-commit` to experience the full validation process
3. **Start development**: Create GitHub issues and use small steps with testing validation
4. **Use context engineering**: Claude Code now understands your platform automatically

### 🎯 Workflow Benefits Achieved

- **Issue-driven development** with GitHub Issues + feature branches
- **Comprehensive testing gates** protect your 128+ tests
- **Ask-first friends-connect integration** maintains architectural control
- **Automated documentation maintenance** via context engineering
- **Natural language OR slash commands** for flexibility
- **Git discipline** with branch validation and commit gates

### 📊 Your Platform Status

Your gaming platform remains fully operational:
- ✅ 5 Production microservices deployed
- ✅ 128+ tests protected with validation
- ✅ Real-time multiplayer tic-tac-toe working
- ✅ k3d cluster with SSE streaming
- ✅ Complete web-based gaming interface

**Now enhanced with disciplined Claude Code workflow!**
