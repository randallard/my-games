Review my current development status using the context files in .claude/context/ and show me:

1. **Current Git branch and any uncommitted changes**
2. **Testing state across all services**  
3. **k3d cluster status and pod health**
4. **Current issue context** from .claude/context/current-issue.md
5. **Next steps for development**

Check the files and provide a comprehensive dashboard view with:
- Branch naming validation (should follow issue-###-description)
- Test file counts across services
- Cluster and pod status
- Documentation currency
- Available commands summary
- Friends-connect integration status

Update the timestamp in .claude/context/current-issue.md when complete.
